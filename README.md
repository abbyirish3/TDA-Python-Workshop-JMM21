# TDA-Python-Workshop-JMM21

This repository includes the jupyter notebooks for the 2021 Workshop ["Mathematical and Computational Methods for Complex Social Systems"](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://meetings.ams.org/math/sc2021/meetingapp.cgi) to be held at the virtual JMM 2021, led by [Elizabeth Munch](http://elizabethmunch.com/). This introduction is tailored for a network science audience, so the focus is on an relevant tools when given a network input.

The goals of this 1-hour introduction are:

- Give a brief overview of available packages
- Provide pipelines for computing persistent homology for input data such as a discrete metric space and a weighted graph.  
- Show some basic ways to interface with machine learning toolkits
